# EKIS authorization: chrome extension and server-side python wsgi app

This is a google chrome extension and server script providing separate username+password credentials for single http://lk.educom.ru school account. LDAP server is used by the server to authenticate client. If the credentials are good, server requests a session from http://lk.educom.ru and sends session cookies to the client. The extention then sets those http-only cookies using chrome API.
